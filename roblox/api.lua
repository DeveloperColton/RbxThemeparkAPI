	RbxThemeparkAPI by ProgrammerColton
	
	A simple API that gets wait times and information based on the themeparks that you choose on ROBLOX game servers.
	
	Note: This ain't nothing special, just did it for fun and probably will really server no purpose. 
	I did it solely to improve my knowledge of the JS coding language and how to work with http and various servers.
	
	Docs:
	
	Path: /parks/list
	Desc: Returns a list of all parks and their ids.

	Path: /parks/:park/rides
	Desc: Returns a list of all rides and their data in the park.
	Params: {park, which must be the park id from "/parks/list}
	
	Path: /parks/:park/ride/:ride
	Desc: Returns data about a specific ride from a park.
	Params: {park, which must be the park id from "/parks/list}
			{ride, which must be the ride name which can be gotten from "/parks/:park/rides"}

--// Example:
local httpService = game:GetService("HttpService");
local themeparkModule = require(script.RbxThemeparkAPI);
local themeparkAPI = themeparkModule:Init("YOUR_URL_HERE","YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
--// Note: I recommend removing the "/" at the end of your url, it looks better when you send a path.
--// If you don't remove it though, you'll have to send a path like this "parks/list" instead of "/parks/list".

local test = themeparkAPI:Get("/parks/list");
for i,v in pairs(test) do
	print(v.name);
end
